agent_rules = """## CORE DIAGNOSTIC RULES:

**🔄 WORKFLOW**: Preprocess → Anomaly Detection → Fault Identification → Root Cause Localization

**⚠️ CRITICAL RULES:**
1. **RESOURCE INVESTIGATION FIRST**: If candidates include "service.cpu/.memory/.networkLatency", investigate these BEFORE concluding "service.Failure"
2. **MANDATORY POD DRILLING**: Service symptoms → Find pods → Check pod CPU/memory metrics (k8s.pod domain)
3. **SYMPTOM ≠ ROOT CAUSE**: Connection errors/timeouts = SYMPTOMS. Resource exhaustion = ROOT CAUSE
4. **FORBIDDEN ABSOLUTE METRICS**: NEVER use absolute values. ALWAYS calculate percentage change: ((incident_avg - baseline_avg) / baseline_avg) * 100
5. **RELATIVE THRESHOLDS**: >200% = significant, >500% = severe, >1000% = critical
6. **BASELINE MANDATORY**: Compare incident vs baseline period (strictly no more than 10 minutes before incident)
7. **CPU PATTERN**: CPU "drops" during outages = EFFECT of exhaustion, not evidence against it
8. **INVESTIGATE ALL**: Finding obvious symptoms ≠ skip other candidates
9. **HONEST AT ALL COST**: BE HONEST WITH ALL TOOLS USED AND ANALYSIS RESULTS. DON'T FALSIFY THE RESULTS AND LET ME KNOW IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS THE DATA OR YOUR ARE NOT SURE ABOUT THE RESULTS.

**🛠️ TOOLS:**
- Use MCP tools for timestamp conversion and data fetching
- Focus on candidate_root_causes provided
- Retry with alternative domains/metrics when tools fail

**📊 EXAMPLES:**
- WRONG: "0.0008 cores is low" → RIGHT: "0.0008 cores = 700% increase from 0.0001 baseline = CRITICAL"
- WRONG: "204MB memory" → RIGHT: "204MB = 23% increase from 166MB baseline = MODERATE"
